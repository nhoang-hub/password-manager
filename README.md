# password manager
This password manager securely stores, retrieves, and manages encrypted passwords, providing features like a master password, password generation, and data reset to enhance security and simplify credential management.

Key features of the password manager include master password protection, which restricts access to authorized users, and the ability to store and retrieve encrypted passwords for various accounts. The tool also includes a password generator that creates strong, customizable passwords to meet individual needs. Additionally, users can reset the manager, which securely deletes all stored data and encryption keys, ensuring a fresh start when necessary.

To get started, install Python 3.6 or higher and the cryptography library by running pip install cryptography. 

This GitHub repository contains the abovementioned password manager as a ".py" file and detailed documentation in PDF and Word formats.
